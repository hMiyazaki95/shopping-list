What is locatlStorage / sessionStorage?

Property on the `window interface that allows us to access
a Storage object

Data is stored in the browser

Data is stored as key/value pairs and values are strings (can not store objects).

localStorage and sessionStorage have the same API. The difference is that
the localStorage does not expire, while sessionStorage only lasts until the 
page is closed.


localStorage Methods

localStorage.setItem('name', 'Brad'); // set a value with the key
localStorage.getItem('name'); //get a value using the key
localStorage.removeItem('name'); // remove item using the key
localStorage.clear(); // clear all values
